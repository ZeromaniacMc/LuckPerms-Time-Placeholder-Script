# LuckPerms-Time-Placeholder-Script
Version 2.0 of the LuckPerms Time Placeholder Output Replacement

This project was inspired by the many voices in the official [LuckPerms Discord](https://discord.gg/luckperms) who wanted to customize the output of the expiry placeholders 
that LuckPerms provides. The first version of this script did not have the ability to do math, which was probably the reason why it didn't get very popular. 
However, we changed that in this version! 


**What you can do with it:**

➢ Customize the names of the units.

➢ Shorten the outcome to a time format of your liking.

➢ Define a singular and plural word to use for each unit.

➢ Display any symbol/text if a permission is infinite.

➢ Define an output if the user does not have the permission in question.

➢ Cut off parts you do not wish to see.


Please follow the installation instructions given in the file itself.
We are painfully aware that overusage of javascripts or scripts in general may or may not impact performance so we would like to encourage you
to be careful if you are a heavy script user. 

I no longer play Minecraft, so this script has been abandoned. If you want to update it and publish a fresher version, feel free to do so. All I ask is to not monetize this script or edits of it.
